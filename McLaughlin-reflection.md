What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

-I was struggling with some of the general work flow and some of the basics of Github.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
-Joey helped clarify some of my git syntax as well as the workflow. Despite not having a partner, he was very good at informing me on how GPS's usually work. He also showed me some shortcuts to use in the terminal.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
-I asked my guide anything I was curious about. If something was in the proper syntax. What would happen if I left something out? More information about merge conflicts and why they can happen.

What still confuses you about Git?
I feel like i have a good grasp on Git, for a beginner, and that more knowledge about it will come over time with practice.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great. Joey was extremely helpful and informative. I am interested to see what it will be like when I have a pair.
